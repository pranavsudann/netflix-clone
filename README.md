A professional Netflix clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates the core features of the Netflix streaming platform, including a responsive design, interactive movie carousels, and a search bar. It serves as a great example of front-end development skills and can be extended with backend functionality for a full-stack application.
